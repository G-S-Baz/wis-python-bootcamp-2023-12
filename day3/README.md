## Assignment - Day 3

* Given a text file that contains several dirty sequences create several repots.
* A "dirty" nucleotide is one that besides ACTG also has a few X-es.
* The file has many rows.
* Each row can have one or more sequences. The sequences are separated by one or more spaces.
* The clean parts of a sequence is called a subsequence.
e.g.

AAACTXTGA    TAGXCT
CTAXGG

In this example we have the following subsequences: "AAACT", "TGA",  "TAG", "CT", "CTA", "GG".

## Reports

* How many sequences are there?
* How many different subsequences are there and how many times each subsequence appears?
* How many times each nucleotide appears in the whole file and how many errors are there? What is the frequency of each nucleotide and the errors?
* The code should ask the user for the name of the file containing the sequences.
* The name of the file should be `analyze_sequence.py`
* Upload it to Dropbox using the same link
* Dead-line: 20:00 ILT on Saturday, January 6, 2024.
