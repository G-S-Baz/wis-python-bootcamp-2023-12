I divided them up by the days so it will be easier to find them.

## Assignment - Day 2

Take the code from the last example we had and ask the user to supply the 3 parameters we need to start the game. Then further enhance the game so it will be able to give and verify exercises with all 4 basic mathematical operations. Make the user provide the operator s/he wants to be tested.

The mode:
* The filename should be `calculator_game_day_2.py`
* In the file add a comment with your full name in latin letter (or names, if you submit the solution in pairs)
* Upload to Dropbox via this link ...
