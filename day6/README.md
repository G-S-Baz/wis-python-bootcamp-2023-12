# Day 6


* [The pull-request from last week](https://github.com/biopython/biopython.github.io/pull/202).

* [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

* [The demo project](https://github.com/cm-demo/wis-2023-12-demo).

* [The GitHub pages demo](https://github.com/cm-demo/cm-demo.github.io) that can be seen at [this address](https://cm-demo.github.io/) - it will be renamed to [new url](https://github.com/cm-demo/cm-demo.github.io-wis-2023-12) later so I'll be able to demonstrate the process of creating a web site again.

* [GitHub Flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

* GitHub uses Jekyll by default. There are many other [Static Site Generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/).


* [Videos of earlier projects](https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists)


## Assignment

* Create a GitHub account and crate a GitHub page for yourself. You are invited to add as little or as much about yourself on the pages as you like. For ideas check out [this site](https://osdc.code-maven.com/osdc-2023-01-public/)  In the "Pages" menu you will see a list of the students who participated in that course who created a page. That was not a WIS course, but one person was a former student of mine in WIS.
* Create an issue on [our repository](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-bootcamp-2023-12) including links to both your public page and the repository that contains the source. This is how you submit the assignment.
