## Assignment

* Pick a series of data (e.g. from your lab) and create some interesting graphs in an Excel file. It is up to you what you feel as being interesting.
* If the data is not in Excel then copy it to the Excel file (meaning that your program should copy the data) if it is already in an Excel file then you might need to copy to some other file, but maybe you can add the image to the existing file.
* Where to get the data from?
    * Your lab probably has something interesting
    * e.g. Kaggle has lots of free [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
    * On the web site of the [U.S. Department of Education](https://sites.ed.gov/foreigngifts/) you can find the list of foreign donations.  There is a link download the [most recent data](https://sites.ed.gov/foreigngifts/files/2023/12/Sec-117-Public-Records-Complete-Oct-13-2023.xlsx). Try to analyze that and create some interesting report.
    * I am sure there are many other sources.
