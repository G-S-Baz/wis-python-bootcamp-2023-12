Hi,

Welcome to the Programming bootcamp!

I hope you are all ok and safe!

I am the lecturer. Please just call me Gabor. I don't have any title and it feels really strange when someone calls me Mr. Szabo.

## Zoom

The course is going to start on 2023.12.17 Sunday at 9:00 am. We are going to use Zoom. The lectures will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube so you will be able to watch them later as well.
If you don't want to appear in the video then please turn off the camera.

Recording the presentations will also help those who are not able to attend the sessions.

## Email

If you'd like to send me an email, please preserve the subject line. That will help me know which course you are in.

## WhatsApp

I've created two WhatsApp groups for faster communication.
A group with me:

> WhatsApp link

For students only:

> WhatsApp link

I'll pass the administrator to the first person who joins.

You are invited to join both

You can also add me to your phone book to make it easier to identify me:
Gabor Szabo +972-54-4624648
In Hebrew:
גאבור סבו


## Participation in the lectures

There is no requirement to participate in the lectures. You will be able to watch the videos later. However, it is recommended to participate as that gives you an opportunity to ask questions.

## Assignments

There will be assignments after every lecture. I don't yet have access to Moodles so we are still working out the technical details on how you will submit the assignments.
You can do the assignments in pairs.
Inside each assignment you must write your full name in latin letters and the name of your pair if you do it in pairs.

## Project

At the end of the course you'll be asked to do a project. You can do that too in pairs.
First you need to submit a proposal for the project and when it is accepted then implement it.
The project should be something that is useful for your studies or at least it is fun for you to make.
Ask in the lab where you work what needs are there that you might implement as your final project.

## Reserve Duty

If you are on reserve duty, please let me know so we can figure out how to make you succeed in this course.

## Grades

Each assignment counts as 5% (we will have 10 of them)
The project proposal is 15%
The project is 35%

## Slides

During the course I'll use some of the slides that can be found here: https://code-maven.com/slides/python/ These slides are publicly available and will remain on the web site after the course is over.

## Videos in English

I have a recording of this course from 3 years ago. Feel free to watch those:
https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists
Please also follow my YouTube Channel and "like" the videos there:
https://code-maven.com/youtube

## Videos in Hebrew

Some of the material is also available in Hebrew. You can find them on my website:
https://he.code-maven.com/ and in my Hebrew-language YouTube channel
https://he.code-maven.com/youtube
There too, I'd like you to follow the channel and upvote the videos.

## Language

The standard language of WIS and of this course is English.

However, when on one-on-one conversions I'd be happy to speak in Hebrew, Hungarian, Spanish, or Ladino.

## Installations

You can already go ahead and install the software we need.

If you already have Python on your computer, verify that it is at least version 3.7.
If it is, there is no need to install Python.

If you have an older version of Python you might first need to uninstall it.

If you do NOT have Python yet then install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3121/

* Windows:   "Windows installer (64-bit)"
* macOS: "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer"
* Linux: you should be using apt or yum to install python3


In addition we will need an IDE (editor) as well. The recommended one is Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/   but if you already have PyCharm on your computer  and if you'd like to use it, that will be fine as well.


## Any Questions?
