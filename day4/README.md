## 1st hour:
argv and the command line arguments


## 2nd hour:
* Installing tk
* Showing the Tk demo slides https://code-maven.com/slides/python/tk

* started with an "add" function, but then it was important to explain *why* we would like to have functions so we saw the implementation of Fibonacci
first as duplicate code and then as a function.

## 3rd hour:
* modules
* testing

`pip install pytest`

* function returning multiple values

* Assignment: take the solution for the previous assignment you submitted, split it up into functions as you feel fit
make sure functions either do computation or do IO (Input output) meaning print or get input.
Don't put both computation and IO in the same function.

Then move the functions that do computation to a separate file - a module - and use them from the program.
Create a third file with several test to verify the functions in the module. Use these filenames:

* compute_sequence.py   - the main program
* sequence.py           - the module that only has functions
* test_sequence.py      - the tests.

Put all 3 files in a single folder and upload that folder to Dropbox.
